# Pacman_Python

Ghost is the primary class for the enemies
<br>Target System Fetches target
<br>Move Generator gives best move

All classes are done

Left to do:
1. Auto mode cycles
2. Gameover logic according to move cycles
3. Giving images

Had to abandon this project but will complete it in a short while.

Meanwhile a working prototype of the game is available in the master branch.
